In more technical terms, I:

* **craft semantic HTML,** with a focus on accessibility.
* **author Sass code** that manages the visual aspects, fluid typography, colors, responsive behavior, and anything in between.
* **write presentational JavaScript** that controls the interactive behavior of the UI components.
* **test across various devices** and browsers, and optimize for performance.
