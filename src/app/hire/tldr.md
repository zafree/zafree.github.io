# I’m a dev-minded designer.

## Also called Front-End Designer, UX Engineer, or Design Engineer.#

I’m an Independent Design Engineer with 11+ years of experience, focused on design and design implementation. I help create functional, user-centered, simple _(yet better)_ digital products that look visually good.

Experienced in working with the private and public sectors, designed digital projects for e-commerce, food chains, fantasy sports, public education, consultancies, startups, communities, and tech agencies.

Also, I work on the [front-end of the front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/). In this way, my work lies at the intersection of design and back-end. All of my dev work is, _by default_:

- **Optimized for mobile.** I take a mobile-first approach to building front-ends.
- **Fully responsive,** and tested across various devices and browsers.
- **Cross-browser compatible.** If you need someone to create the exact same experience in all browsers, you’re probably better working with me.
- **Vanilla.**
- **Optimized for performance.** The product experience needs to feel lightweight and fast.

In more technical terms, I:

- **write semantic HTML,** with a focus on accessibility.
- **write CSS** with [dart sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/) that manages the visual aspects, fluid typography, colors, responsive behavior, and anything in between.
- **write presentational JavaScript** that controls the interactive behavior of the UI components.
- **test** across various devices and browsers, and optimize for performance.

I’ve worked with clients in various sectors and markets, but my favorite clients are those working in the following sectors that I am personally passionate about:

- **E-commerce.** I have five years of experience working in the e-commerce sector in Bangladesh.

- **Fantasy Sports.** Exploring the US fantasy sports landscape and diving into React Native development.

- **Food & Restaurant.**
- **Public Education.**

- **Nature & Wildlife.** ❤️

- **Travel & Tourism.**

- **Photography & Magazines.** If I weren’t a designer, I’d probably be a nomadic wildlife photographer.

- **Open Source.** I love open source projects.

- **Community & Meetup.**
