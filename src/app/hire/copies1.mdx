I’m a designer who codes, very much focused on design implementation, does production-ready HTML and CSS. I can work within your projects like React, React-native, or any.

I hold myself to high standards, and provide high value for the investment you make in me. All of my work is, *by default*:

* **Optimized for mobile.** I take a mobile-first approach to building front-ends.
* **Fully responsive,** and tested across various devices and browsers.
* **Cross-browser compatible.** If you need someone to create the exact same experience in all browsers, you’re probably better working with me.
* **Vanilla.** I don’t like to use any JavaScript frameworks in my work. But I can work within your projects like React, React-native, or any.
* **Optimized for performance.** The product experience needs to feel lightweight and fast.
