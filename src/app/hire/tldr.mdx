      I’m a designer who codes, very much focused on design implementation, does production-ready HTML and CSS. I can work within your projects like React, React-native, or any.

      I hold myself to high standards, and provide high value for the investment you make in me. All of my work is, *by default*:

      * **Optimized for mobile.** I take a mobile-first approach to building front-ends.
      * **Fully responsive,** and tested across various devices and browsers.
      * **Cross-browser compatible.** If you need someone to create the exact same experience in all browsers, you’re probably better working with me.
      * **Vanilla.** I don’t like to use any JavaScript frameworks in my work. But I can work within your projects like React, React-native, or any.
      * **Optimized for performance.** The product experience needs to feel lightweight and fast.

      In more technical terms, I:

      * **craft semantic HTML,** with a focus on accessibility.
      * **author Sass code** that manages the visual aspects, fluid typography, colors, responsive behavior, and anything in between.
      * **write presentational JavaScript** that controls the interactive behavior of the UI components.
      * **test across various devices** and browsers, and optimize for performance.

      I’ve worked with clients in various sectors and markets, but my favorite clients are those working in the following sectors that I am personally passionate about:

      * **Fantasy & Daily Fantasy Sports.** It’s been a blast exploring the US fantasy sports landscape and diving into React Native development!

      * **E-commerce.** I have five years of experience working in the e-commerce sector in Bangladesh.

      * **Food & Restaurant.**

      * **Nature & Wildlife.** ❤️
      * **Travel & Tourism.** 
      * **Photography & Magazines.** If I weren’t a web developer, I’d probably be a nomadic wildlife photographer.
      * **Open Source.** I love open source projects.

      * **Tech & Education.**

      * **Community & Meetup.**
