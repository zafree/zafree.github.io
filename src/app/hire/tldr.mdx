      I’m an Independent Design Engineer with 11+ years of experience, 
      focused on design and design implementation. 
      I help create functional, user-centered, 
      simple *(yet better)* digital products that look visually good.

      Experienced in working with the private and public sectors, designed digital projects for e-commerce, food chains, fantasy sports, public education, consultancies, startups, communities, and tech agencies.

      Also, I work on the [front-end of the front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/).
      In this way, my work lies at the intersection of design and back-end.
      All of my dev work is, *by default*:
      
      * **Optimized for mobile.** I take a mobile-first approach to building front-ends.
      * **Fully responsive,** and tested across various devices and browsers.
      * **Cross-browser compatible.** If you need someone to create the exact same experience in all browsers, you’re probably better working with me.
      * **Vanilla.**
      * **Optimized for performance.** The product experience needs to feel lightweight and fast.

      In more technical terms, I:

      * **write semantic HTML,** with a focus on accessibility.
      * **write CSS** with [dart sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/) that manages the visual aspects, fluid typography, colors, responsive behavior, and anything in between.
      * **write presentational JavaScript** that controls the interactive behavior of the UI components.
      * **test** across various devices and browsers, and optimize for performance.

      * [write an unusual `font-size` approach for fluid typography.](/loremipsum/fluid-typography)

      I’ve worked with clients in various sectors and markets, but my favorite clients are those working in the following sectors that I am personally passionate about:

      * **E-commerce.** I have five years of experience working in the e-commerce sector in Bangladesh.

      * **Fantasy Sports.** Exploring the US fantasy sports landscape and diving into React Native development.

      * **Food & Restaurant.**
      * **Public Education.**

      * **Nature & Wildlife.** ❤️
      
      * **Travel & Tourism.** 
      
      * **Photography & Magazines.** If I weren’t a designer, I’d probably be a nomadic wildlife photographer.
      
      * **Open Source.** I love open source projects.

      * **Community & Meetup.**

      I have a few standards:

      * **Impossible? I’m on it.** I won’t say "impossible" isn’t in my vocabulary, but I love taking on new challenges.
      * **Think mobile-first.** The universe is big, but technically, we can grab it with our hands. More than 80% of traffic now comes from mobile devices. Thats why I always think mobile-first.
      * **Make it simple.** It took me a while to realize that people love simple things and hate complexities. Ever since I understood that I started building simple things.
