# Step 6

This is the last step. 

I ask myself, does my website or application have multiple pages or routes?

If yes, I use `react-route-dom`. 

Once my website loads, itâ€™s allowing me to navigate between pages without any browser refreshing.
It's like magic, delivering a smooth user experience while navigation. 

Install it as a dependency:

~~~terminal
yarn add react-router-dom
~~~

* ðŸ”€ [`react-router-dom`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/main/packages/react-router-dom) navigate between pages without any browser refreshing.

After that, I followed [the tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial), 
spending an hour to set up everything I needed. I have to do just two things.



1st, wrap `AppLayout` component with `BrowserRouter` in my `App.tsx` file:
~~~tsx
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
import AppLayout from './components/app-layout/AppLayout'

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <AppLayout />
    </BrowserRouter>
  )
}

export default App
~~~

2nd, set up `NavLink` and `Routes` in `AppLayout` component:

~~~tsx
import { NavLink, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom'
import Home from '../../pages/home/Home'
import Contact from '../../pages/contact/Contact'

function AppLayout() {
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <NavLink to="/">Home</NavLink>
        <NavLink to="/contact">Contact</NavLink>
      </nav>
      <Routes>
        <Route index element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="contact" element={<Contact />} />
      </Routes>
    </>
  )
}

export default AppLayout
~~~

All done! This setup will enable navigation between my pages without browser refreshing.
