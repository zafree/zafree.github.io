# Few words

I thought it might be a good idea to write a few words about why I went to the trouble of 
creating my own starter kit.

With every new project, I used to copy what I did on the previous project, remove everything 
except the boilerplate, add a few tools and refactor the code a bit. Rinse and repeat.

So, I created my first react starter kit [`react-locally`](https://github.com/zafree/react-locally) 
to avoid going through this painful procedure every time I started a project, with the goal of 
getting me up and running faster with all the tools and libraries I needed.

## Why I create my own? 

As you may know, Facebook created their own starter kit called `create-react-app`, developed 
by the React community, and maintained by Facebook. It includes all the basics needed to get 
started, which is why it’s so popular and used by a lot of developers.

So, why didn’t I just use that?

**The serious answer** is that, I don’t know JavaScript, 
and there is so many `dependencies` and `devDependency` in that project. 
Looking inside it feels like I’m dead.
That’s why I threw myself into a painful procedure of creating my own react starter kit.

**Another answer** is that, as a poor and low cost web developer, I eat CSS. 
But when it comes to JavaScript books or projects, 80% of it goes over my head.
I set a basic rule— if I don’t know what this framework or plugin is for, I won’t use it. 

So I have to know, or learn first. 

The funny thing is, when it comes to learning new things, my brain acts like a sloth, 
so I go slow.
