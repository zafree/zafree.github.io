# Step 4

I love CSS, and [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/) is my go-to for every project.
Vite or React does not provide built-in support for `.scss`, `.sass`, `.less`, `.styl` or `stylus` files. 

To use `sass`, first I have to install it:

~~~terminal
yarn add sass -D
~~~

* üñåÔ∏è [`dart-sass`](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/) CSS with superpowers.

Now I just need to use CSS modules combined with `sass` by prepending `.module` to 
the file extension, for example `Header.module.sass`. 

Just need a [few adjustments](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#css-modules) 
on render classNames. I prefer `localsConvention: 'camelCase'` and shorter `generateScopedName`. 

To do that, open `vite.config.ts` file and add a `css` section as follows:

~~~ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
+ css: {
+   modules: {
+     localsConvention: 'camelCase',
+     generateScopedName: '[local]__[hash:base64:4]',
+   },
+ },
})

~~~

Now there‚Äôs no need to worry about class names mismatching.
