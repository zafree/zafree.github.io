## Why I keep it open source?

For me. Simple.

Imagine you’re in a huge library, trying to find a book. Sometimes, you forget where you put it!
That’s me with my code. So, I keep it open source, like leaving a map for myself.

And, I believe there is someone who might have similar needs as mine. Feel free to check it out, folk. 
Contribute if you think something’s missing.

And if you just want to get started, the quickest way, if you already have git and node, 
is this:

~~~
git clone -b main git@github.com:zafree/react-locally.git your-project
cd your-project
yarn install
yarn dev
~~~
