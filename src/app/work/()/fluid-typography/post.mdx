If you are a web developer, you’ve probably seen font-size declarations something like this:

~~~css
body {
  font-size: calc(21px + 3 * ((100vw - 375px) / 825));
}
~~~

But back in 2017, I saw an unusual font-size declaration for the first time:

~~~css
body {
  font-size: calc(1.9393939394vw + 2.8727272727em);
}
~~~

The calculation seemed like magic, leaving me scratching my head.
I had no idea how it worked or how it was calculated. 
I searched online but couldn’t find any answers.
Still, I had to figure it out myself. It seemed pretty cool to explore.

In 2024, the frustration grew as I continued to work with fluid font sizes. 
But I remain hopeful that one day, I’ll unlock its logic, inshallah.

# I know the fundamental

Here’s the math, credit [Mike Riethmuller:](https://www.madebymike.com.au/writing/fluid-type-calc-examples/)

~~~css
body {
  font-size: calc(min_font + (max_font - min_font) * ((100vw - min_viewport_width) / (max_viewport_width - min_viewport_width)));
}
~~~

This is a simplified version of fluid font size with pixels. 
If I want the font size to range from `21px` on a `375px` screen to `24px` on a `1200px` screen, it would be like this:

~~~css
body {
  font-size: 21px;
  font-size: calc(21px + (24 - 21) * ((100vw - 375px) / (1200 - 375)));
}
@media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
  body {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
} 
~~~

Browsers will render the `calc()` function as follows:

~~~
body {
  font-size: calc(21px + 3 * (100vw - 375px) / 825);
}
~~~

This isn’t what I want. 

I want to render something like this:

~~~
body {
  font-size: calc(0.3636363636vw + 19.6363636364px);
}
~~~

So, I need to do some basic math. But it took me 7 years to figure it out. 
Here’s an example:

~~~css
// math
1: 21px + (24 - 21) * ((100vw - 375px) / (1200 - 375))
2: 21px + (24 - 21) * ((100vw / (1200 - 375)) - (375px / (1200 - 375)))
3: 21px + ((24 - 21) * (100vw / (1200 - 375))) - ((24 - 21) * (375px / (1200 - 375)))
4: ((24 - 21) * (100vw / (1200 - 375))) + (21px - ((24 - 21) * (375px / (1200 - 375))))  

// browser will render 
1: 21px + 3 * (100vw - 375px) / 825
2: 21px + 3 * (0.1212121212vw - 0.4545454545px)
3: 21px + 0.3636363636vw - 1.3636363636px
4: 0.3636363636vw + 19.6363636364px
~~~

Last one is the output I want. So here’s the final math: 

~~~css
body {
  font-size: calc(((max_font - min_font) * 100vw / (max_viewport_width - min_viewport_width)) + (min_font  - ((max_font - min_font) * min_viewport_width) / (max_viewport_width - min_viewport_width)));
}
~~~

# In Sass

I love Sass, and [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/) is my go-to for every project. 
When it comes to units, I prefer `em`. Remember, `1em = 16px`. To keep things simple, I start by setting the body font-size to `62.5%`, making `1em = 10px`.

~~~sass
body
  font-size: 62.5%
~~~

Finally I’ve crafted a (pretty robust) [@mixin](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin/), like this:

~~~sass
// Fluid Font Size (ffs)
// target: calc(vw + em)

@use "sass:math"

@function strip-unit($value)
  @return math.div($value, ($value * 0 + 1))

=ffs($fs-max, $fs-min, $w-max: strip-unit($w-max), $w-min: strip-unit($w-min))
  font-size: calc(($fs-max - $fs-min) * 100vw / ($w-max - $w-min) + (($fs-min * .1em) - ($fs-max - $fs-min) * ($w-min * .1em) / ($w-max - $w-min)))
~~~

Here’s how I use it:

~~~sass
$w-min: 375px
$w-max: 1200px

p
  +ffs(24, 21)
~~~

Now, the browser renders my desired target:

~~~css
p {
  font-size: calc(0.3636363636vw + 1.9636363636em);
}
~~~

# Conclusion

Yes, after 7 long years, I’ve finally cracked its logic. Alhamdulillah.

Am I leaving you scratching your head? 
I understand it’s tough. Fluid font sizes, result like `calc(vw + em)`, 
might seem tricky initially, but with the right approach, 
you’ll get there too. Read well, be patient. Best of luck!
