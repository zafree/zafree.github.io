      # Let’s start the journey with my story
    
      I graduated from [BUBT](https://www.bubt.edu.bd/), not [BUET](https://buet.ac.bd/).

      If I dig into my whole student life, all I can recall— I was a very bright student, 
      but when the exam results came, I ended up getting beaten by my dad.

      So you see, my intelligence was getting beaten by my dad. 

      My dad always told me that plowing land is not possible with a goat. 
      It took me a while to understand that I had to become a cow.
      I had to take on the responsibility of my family.

      With that experience of being beaten and telling everyone— I love you, I ended up 
      entering the professional world through a tiny gap.

      ## Year 2016

      It rained. Sitting at my workstation, thinking about my university days. It’s been almost 
      3 years since I graduated. Miss my university days and everyone around me.

      Later, I made some calls, trying to connect with some of my classmates over the phone. 
      After talking for a few minutes, I decided to organize a meetup.

      <br />

      ## Why professionals meetup?

      Like me, many students have graduated and stepped into professional life, each facing 
      their own struggles or finding their place. But now, we’ve lost touch with each other.


      Here, I’ll try to reconnect with each other, providing an opportunity for current students
      to meet real-life professionals and learn from their success or failure stories.

      I hope that we, as BUBT Professionals, can build a strong community for BUBT, for ourselves.
