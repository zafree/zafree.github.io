      # Let’s Make Some Noise

      After the website goes live, I reach out to some of my classmates and juniors, 
      asking for their help. From now on, we’ll share stories about former BUBTians 
      on social media using the hashtag **#BUBTAwesome**

      The response from social media was incredible. Everyone was eager to join the event. 
      However, seats were limited. We closed registration with 62 participants and 6 guests. 
      It was a huge success!

      # Tee Design and Creation

      The tee design concept is straightforward. The front part of the tee has a blank space. 
      Everyone will write their name on that space using a permanent marker. 

      This way, you’ll know everyone’s name without having to ask. It helps break the ice 
      and encourages people to step forward and start conversations.

      I love making tees. My friend owns a garment factory, so I got his help. I even visited 
      the factory to check the fabric quality for our yellow tees. I love the color and fabric.

      # The end

      Just look at the pictures. No need to tell anything.
