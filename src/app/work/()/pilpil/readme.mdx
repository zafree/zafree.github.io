      # Pilpil - Progressive Image Loading

      Pilpil is a tiny, pure JavaScript library for Progressive Image Loading with a blur effect to reduce the page load time; as seen on [Medium](https://medium.com/designing-medium/image-zoom-on-medium-24d146fc0c20).

      Check out [Demo](https://zafree.github.io/pilpil) or [Github](https://github.com/zafree/pilpil) 

      # How

      **Step 1:** Link files to your site or application (add `<script>` to bottom of page)

      ```html
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="pilpil.css" />
      <script src="pilpil.js"></script>
      ```

      **Step 2:** Set markup

      ```html
      <div
        class="image"
        data-width="original_width"
        data-height="original_height"
        data-small="small_image_path"
        data-large="original_image_path"
        data-alt="image_alt">
      </div>
      ```

      <br />

      ## Why

      It's the best way to load an image. No dependencies. Pure JavaScript. Progressive Image Loading with a blur effect. Reduce the page loading time. Better user experience. Wow.

      <br />

      ## Where

      Pilpil should (in theory) work in all relevant browsers. If not, create an [issue](https://github.com/zafree/pilpil/issues)! Thanks!
