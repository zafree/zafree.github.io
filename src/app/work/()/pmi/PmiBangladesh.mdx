      # Long story short
      
      [Shafiq bhai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smshafiqul/) asked me to do a favor and provide a design proposal for their upcoming meetup. 
      So, I created some quick visual shots and shared them with him. Unfortunately, they didn't like it much. 
      End of story.

      Here are some shots from the design:

      <Pilpil

        height={480}
        small={`/work/pmi/image1-small.jpg`}
        large={`/work/pmi/image1.jpg`}
        alt="image1"
        caption="Spekers section"
      />
      <br />
