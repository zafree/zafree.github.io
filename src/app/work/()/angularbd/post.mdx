      # How to localize a global event?
      
      How do I localize a global event? Do you want to hair my answer? Ok. Here it is— copy pasting is the answer. Let me explain... 

      Since the meetup is an extended version of the global Angular community meetup, the local logo should resemble the main Angular logo. Like father, like son. Logo must came from its parent.

      <br />

        <_col>
          <Pilpil
            width={121}

            small="/work/angularbd/image1-small.jpg"
            large="/work/angularbd/image1.jpg"
            alt="image1"
            caption="ng logo"
          />
        </_col>
        <_col>
          <Pilpil
            width={121}
            height={130}
            small="/work/angularbd/image1-small.jpg"
            large="/work/angularbd/image2.jpg"
            alt="image2"
            caption="ng-bd logo"
          />
        </_col>
      </_row> 
      <br />
      <Pilpil
        width={540}
        height={173}
        small="/work/angularbd/image3-small.jpg"
        large="/work/angularbd/image3.jpg"
        alt="image3"
        caption="ng-bd logotype"
      />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      # It’s color time

      Similar to the logo the color should also resemble the parent. But as you can image the son doesn't always turn out to be like his father. So I tweaked a little.

      # I’m dump at gradient

      The experiment begun. Like the mad scientists who go crazy on their lab. I started playing with the logo and its color. Then it hit me. Wouldn't it look better with gradient?

      Then comes the Oopsie moment and I realized I gradient is not my thing. So I shout out and [Shemul](https://dribbble.com/hishahadat) comes to the rescue. He is a brilliant designer who loves to play with gradient. Enjoy the house blend of Shemul's gradient version of the logo.

      # Finally logo looks awesome

      There it is! Like the jury, we reached our verdict. Everybody was on the same page that it looks awesome. This is the new Angular Bangladesh Meetup logo that emerged from a combined effort.

    Angular and the community; two entities connected together beautifully. And the one thing that outshines the others is their simplicity. It is exactly what reflected in the brand guide.

    I have mention one named called [Al-Jamee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tijamee/) here. He is an awesome print designer for our local industry. If I need something quick, then I knocked him and asking for his fever. Every time he delivered me the right assets. Just check this beatiful illustration he made.  Just love it. It’s a perfect mach with this ready-steady-ng typo.
