      Ordering food through third-party apps is convenient, but itâ€™s expensive â€” 
      especially for restaurants. These apps charge high fees, making it hard 
      for restaurants to stay profitable.

      To fix this, weâ€™ve been working to develop an online ordering system just for restaurants. Itâ€™s a SaaS product that lets them take orders directly, skipping the costly middleman.

      Right now, itâ€™s in beta, and 10-15 restaurants are already trying it out. The feedback has been great so far!

      Our mission is to make online ordering easier and more affordable for restaurants everywhere. ðŸš€
