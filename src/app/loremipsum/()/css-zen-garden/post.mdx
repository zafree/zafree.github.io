      # The story
      The [CSS Zen Garden](https://csszengarden.com/) is a World Wide Web development resource 
      built to demonstrate what can be accomplished visually through CSS-based design.
      It launched in May 2003. Check the creator’s notes [here](https://daveshea.com/projects/zen/).

      # How I got this challenge!
      
      While I was looking for a new role, [Shihan boss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mnishihan/) 
      invited me to his office to discuss an opportunity at Deligram. He proposed me to take the challenge, 
      so he can test my designing ability before hiring me.

      <br />


      **The task is simple** — take the challenge. And let me tell you, there are already 
      [216+ design](https://csszengarden.com/pages/alldesigns/) 
      submissions from talented designers worldwide.

      <Image
        width={640}
        height={640}
        small="/loremipsum/css-zen-garden/image1-small.jpg"
        large="/loremipsum/css-zen-garden/image1.jpg"
        alt=""
        caption="There are already 216+ design submissions from talented designers worldwide."
      />

      <br />

      **The challenge rules** — were straightforward yet incredibly demanding:
      - First submit a design.
      - Write CSS to implement it.

      **But here’s the twist** — I couldn’t change a single line of the HTML markup. 
      All the magic had to happen with CSS alone, transforming the same static HTML into something entirely unique and visually stunning.

      # The design

      As part of the process, I started by submitting my design concepts for mobile and 
      desktop views, as per the discussion with Shihan bhai. After the design was reviewed 
      and accepted, I began working on the CSS.

      You can [check out](https://zafree.github.io/csszengarden/) the live version [here](https://zafree.github.io/csszengarden/).

      Here’s the final design: 
    </Main>
  </Row>
  <Row center>
    <Main full>
      <Image
        width={1200}
        height={600}
        small="/loremipsum/css-zen-garden/thumb-small.jpg"
        large="/loremipsum/css-zen-garden/thumb.jpg"
        alt="My design"
        caption={<Link href={`https://zafree.github.io/csszengarden/`} target='_blank'>My design</Link>}
      />
    </Main>
  </Row>
  <Row center>

      # Why this matters
      
      The CSS Zen Garden isn’t just a test of technical skill—it’s a creative challenge that pushes you to think outside the box. It taught me how to work within constraints while still delivering a beautiful and functional design.
