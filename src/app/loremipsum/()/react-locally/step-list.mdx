# Start writing the process

At last, it’s time to learn something new. My brain is already starting to act like a sloth.
So I will go slow. If you’re following, follow me slowly. 

Before starting, I break down the entire process into simple, easy-to-follow steps:

1. setup `Vite + React + TypeScript`
2. level it up with `eslint`, `eslint-airbnb-config`, and
3. get pretty with `prettier`
4. add `dart-sass` + CSS Module
5. testing with `Vitest`
6. integrate `react-router-dom`
