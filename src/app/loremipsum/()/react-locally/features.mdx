## What’s in it?

I need a few features to ensure my development workflow is fast, structured, and efficient. So I choose:

* 🔥 `vite` as build tool. Its hot reloading and page refreshing in blessing fast.
* 👀 `react` as the view.
* 👮 `typescript` as catch types errors early in editor.
* 🧹 `eslint`, `eslint-airbnb-config` and `prettier` - combines performing code formatting. Stop worrying about code style consistency.
* 🖌️ `dart-sass` support - I extend it with CSS Modules.
* 🔀 `react-router-dom` v6 as the router.
* 🪖 `react-helmet-async` provides control of the page title/meta/styles/scripts from within my components. SEO friendly.
* 🧪 `vitest` as the test framework.


All in all there are 24 dependencies in the `react-locally` starter pack… 
I try my best to keep them up to date.
