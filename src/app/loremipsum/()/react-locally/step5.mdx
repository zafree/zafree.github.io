# Step 5

If I have no plans to write any unit tests in my project, I skip this step.


Write unit testing for every component is definitely a best practice. So I do my best to write 
some, even though I’m not good at it. But integrating a testing library is definitely a good 
add-ons. 

Let’s setup `vitest`:

~~~terminal
yarn add vitest -D
~~~

* 🧪 [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/) super fast testing framework.

There is an [example list](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/tree/main/examples) for different
setups provided by Vitest. The one I am going to be utilizing here is `react-testing-lib` 
[this](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/tree/main/examples/react-testing-lib).
You can also check out [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

To get started, I am going to install:

~~~terminal
yarn add -D jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
~~~ 

* 🍃 [`jsdom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom) manipulate the virtual DOM, tests without launching a real browser.
* 🪶 [`@testing-library/react`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) light-weight solution for testing React components.
* 🎭 [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-jest-dom) provides custom DOM element matchers for [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

Now from the [example](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/tree/main/examples/react-testing-lib),
open their [config](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/blob/main/examples/react-testing-lib/vite.config.ts) 
file and update my `vite.config.ts` accordingly:

~~~ts
+ /* eslint-disable import/no-extraneous-dependencies */
+ /// <reference types="vitest" />
+ /// <reference types="vite/client" />

import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
+ test: {
+  globals: true,
+  environment: 'jsdom',
+  setupFiles: ['./src/setupTests.ts'],
+  css: true,
+ },
})
~~~

At this point, along with setting `globals: true`, they are instructed that we need to go into
`tsconfig.json` file and update `compilerOptions`:

~~~json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
  + "types": ["vitest/globals"],
    ...
  },
  ...
}
~~~


Now it’s ready to write any unit testing.
