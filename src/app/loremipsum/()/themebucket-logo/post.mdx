      **Here, youâ€™ll see two logos** â€” one is an image created by [Dulal Khan](https://dribbble.com/dklipi), 
      and the other is built entirely with CSS by me. 
      
      **Your challenge?** Guess which one is the 
      image and which one is CSS. 
      
      **Think itâ€™s easy?** Letâ€™s find out how sharp your eye is!

      # Rules â€”

      - Donâ€™t check the source file.
      - No dragging or moving the image with your mouse.
      - Zooming the page is not allowed.
      - No pressing `Ctrl+A` to select everything.

      Ready? Take a good look and make your guess. No cheating, okay? ðŸ˜‰
