       is a wonderful jQuery plugin for making sticky elements. Created by [Leaf](https://x.com/moonscript).

      [Sticky kit](https://leafo.net/sticky-kit/) is a super handy jQuery plugin 
      by [Leaf](https://x.com/moonscript) that makes it easy to create sticky elements. 
      All you need to do is call `stick_in_parent` on the element you want to stick, 
      and it’ll stay inside its parent container, no matter what. Simple, right?

      # The problem

      I was using Sticky Kit with Bootstrap [v3.3.7](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/), 
      and things were going great—until I scrolled to the bottom of the page. 
      For some weird reason, the sticky element (red boxes in my case) just disappeared. 
      Poof! It was gone. This was obviously not what I wanted.

      # The fix

      I don’t know a ton about JavaScript, but I dug into the code to figure out what 
      was going wrong. After a bit (okay, a lot) of trial and error, I came up with a solution. 
      Here’s the code I used to fix it:

      ```js
      function activeStickyKit() {
        $('[data-sticky_column]').stick_in_parent({
            parent: '[data-sticky_parent]'
        });

        // bootstrap col position
        $('[data-sticky_column]')
        .on('sticky_kit:bottom', function(e) {
            $(this).parent().css('position', 'static');
        })
        .on('sticky_kit:unbottom', function(e) {
            $(this).parent().css('position', 'relative');
        });
      };
      ```

      This tweak made sure the sticky part stayed visible, even when I scrolled all the way down.

      # The takeaway

      It took me about two weeks to figure this out, but I’m super happy with the result. 
      Now I can use Sticky Kit with Bootstrap without worrying about disappearing elements. 
      It was frustrating at times, but totally worth it in the end!
